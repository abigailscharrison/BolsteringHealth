        <h1>Our Core Programs</h1>
        <p class="sub">
          Bolstering Health organizes services into five core programs that work together to move people from crisis to stability and long-term independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each program was designed for real people with real barriers — from housing instability and substance use to financial stress and disrupted schooling for children. Our goal is to make sure no one has to navigate these challenges alone.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Housing as Health -->
      <section id="housing">
        <span class="badge">Housing as Health</span>
        <h2>Stable Housing as a Foundation for Wellness</h2>
        <p>
          Housing is healthcare. Without a safe, stable place to live, it becomes nearly impossible to keep appointments, manage medications, or focus on employment, education, or parenting.
        </p>

        <div class="two" style="margin-top:14px">
          <div>
            <h3>Bridge to Independence (18–24)</h3>
            <p>
              Transitional housing and wraparound supports for young adults aging out of foster care. We pair safe housing with paid apprenticeships, coaching, and mental health linkages so young adults can build a stable launchpad into adulthood.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Stability After Incarceration</h3>
            <p>
              Rapid safe housing and reentry supports for returning citizens. Services may include paid transitional work, transportation help, skills training, and ongoing case management, focused on breaking the cycle of incarceration and homelessness.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-top:14px">
          <h3>Families & Individuals in Need</h3>
          <p>
            For households facing eviction, unsafe living conditions, or chronic instability. We help families access housing, then provide budgeting support, benefits navigation, and warm handoffs to programs like <em>Steward &amp; Seed</em> and <em>Community Health &amp; Wellness</em>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Substance Abuse & Mental Health Engagement -->
      <section id="engagement">
        <span class="badge">Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Engagement</span>
        <h2>Staying Connected to Care</h2>
        <p>
          Treatment works best when people can stay connected. Many miss appointments because of transportation issues, phone changes, fear, or relapse. Our engagement program is built to close those gaps.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Appointment Outreach &amp; Retention:</strong> Reminders, rescheduling support, and practical problem-solving when barriers come up.</li>
          <li><strong>Between-Visit Engagement:</strong> Check-ins, support groups, or brief touchpoints that keep people connected and motivated.</li>
          <li><strong>Relapse &amp; Crisis Prevention:</strong> A trusted contact to reach out to before things spiral.</li>
          <li><strong>Partner Clinics:</strong> Coordination with providers like <strong>The Carter Clinic, PA</strong> and <strong>B&amp;D Integrated Health Systems</strong> for therapy, psychiatry, and MAT.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Steward & Seed -->
      <section id="steward">
        <span class="badge">Steward &amp; Seed</span>
        <h2>Financial Success with an Investing Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Steward &amp; Seed helps participants see every decision — time, money, habits, relationships — as an investment in their future. We combine financial literacy, behavior change, and professionalism.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Financial Literacy &amp; Empowerment:</strong> Budgeting, saving, credit, and planning using real-life income and expenses.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavioral Health &amp; Wellness:</strong> Addressing the emotional side of money, including impulsive spending and stress.</li>
          <li><strong>Workforce Development &amp; Reentry:</strong> Building habits of professionalism, communication, and reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top:10px">
          The goal is not just “more money,” but financial dignity, stability, and a path toward generational wealth — especially for communities that have been historically excluded.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Children’s Program -->
      <section id="children">
        <span class="badge">Children’s Program</span>
        <h2>Supporting Children Impacted by Instability</h2>
        <p>
          Children are often the quiet witnesses to adult instability. Our Children’s Program is designed for kids who may be behind in school because of unstable housing, a parent’s substance use, or untreated mental health conditions in the home.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Educational Support:</strong> Tutoring, literacy, and academic coaching to help children catch up and stay on track.</li>
          <li><strong>Behavioral &amp; Mental Health Screenings:</strong> Early identification of concerns and warm referrals to child-serving providers.</li>
          <li><strong>Mentorship &amp; Exposure:</strong> Positive role models, career panels, and enrichment opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Life Skills &amp; Money Basics:</strong> Age-appropriate financial literacy and responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Community Health & Wellness -->
      <section id="community">
        <span class="badge">Community Health &amp; Wellness</span>
        <h2>Healthy Habits for Life</h2>
        <p>
          Community Health &amp; Wellness brings prevention, education, and everyday health habits into reach for individuals and families.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Nutrition &amp; Healthy Eating:</strong> Practical teaching on food choices, label reading, and managing conditions like diabetes and hypertension.</li>
          <li><strong>Movement &amp; Exercise:</strong> Walk groups, stretching, and simple routines people can practice at home or in their neighborhood.</li>
          <li><strong>Preventive Care:</strong> Understanding vaccines, dental care, and age-based screenings.</li>
          <li><strong>Sexual Health &amp; Substance Use Awareness:</strong> Honest, judgment-free education to protect future goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Health Tracking:</strong> Monitoring BMI, blood pressure, A1C, and cholesterol — and understanding what the numbers mean.</li>
        </ul>
